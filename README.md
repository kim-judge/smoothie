Data from smoothie sequencing experiment:

smoothie.fastq - data from smoothie sequencing experiment at The Perse School, Cambridge on 14/11/16. The flow cell was R9 and the sequencing kit was the Rapid Sequencing kit SQK-RAD001 

fruit_salad.fastq - data for the challenge.

Challenge! I sequenced some DNA extracted from fruit salad I bought from our canteen. Can you find the best quality fragment of DNA and determine what species it belongs to? 

The read has a qscore (quality score) of 8.8. Can you search through the file to find a read with this quality score? 
(Hint: the name of this read begins with @channel_436, then it is followed by a string of numbers and letters, then the text qscore_8.8)

Highlight just the DNA sequence (text made of ACGT, no other letters or numbers) and paste it into:

http://plantgdb.org/cgi-bin/blast/PlantGDBblast

under step 2. Go to the very start of the text box and add >yournames-test and press enter, so it looks a bit like this:

\>Kims-test
ATATAGATAG.....

Go back to step 1. and click the box marked all species. Then, under organism, click the box marked select all. 

Go down to step 3 and click Run Blast. 

There are a lot of different results. Are any of them linked to a fruit? 

At the moment, it is harder to find out what plant DNA is present in a sample than what bacteria DNA is present. Why do you think this might be?
